This script performs evaluation on bins (containing a particular range of
area in high-res/total area) for their annotation objects

For each bin annotation, it selects a subset of objects which are dependant on the SMALLEST number of
annotations FOR SOME OBJECT TYPE in the smallest bin. This version allows to exclude large objects from
the filtered annotations as well, in case there are 0 in some e.g. 0.9-1.0 bin after filtering

Note:
 - This version DOES equalize the number of annotations of each type (small, med, large)
 - Only difference with bin_eval_per_obj_type_ann_norm is that it allows for large objects to not be present
