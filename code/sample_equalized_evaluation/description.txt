In the main paper, Section 3.2, point (2), we evaluate the detection performance of several
models (DETR, MaskRCNN) on detection information-matched objects. In the Supplementary, Table 
"Sample-equalised evaluation", we provide the prformance. Here we provide the code used
for generating the sample-equalized dataset.
