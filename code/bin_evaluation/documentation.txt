This script performs evaluation on bins (containing a particular range of
area in high-res/total area) for their annotation objects

For each bin annotation, it selects a subset of objects which are dependant on the TOTAL number of
annotations in the smallest bin. E.g. if the total in the smallest bin is 721, the script will select
0.9 * 721 random objects from all other bins, with arbitrarily many small, med, large.

Note: this does not equalize the object types, since the sampling will represent the original
distribution of small, med, large.
