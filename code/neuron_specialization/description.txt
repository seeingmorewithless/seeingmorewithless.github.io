In the main paper, Section 5, point II, we claim that the neurons (filters) of CNNs develop
resolution selectivity even within a single object instance when trained with variable images.
Here we provide the code used for:
 - Extracting CNN featuremap tensors during variable image inference
 - Performing statistical tests on the extracted tensors for the above claim
